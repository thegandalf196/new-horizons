# New Horizons version policy

The single product/module authoring value is [config/newHorizonsVersion.json](../config/newHorizonsVersion.json); current value is `0.85.0`. Menu and generated module read it. This is a development identifier, not a completion percentage or available release. The former 0.85 release/tag was withdrawn.

Product version, VCMI engine revision, save-schema version and Git commit are separate identities. Save epochs change only for actual compatibility boundaries. Source-matched Windows/Linux packages must record the same full source revision; selected playable promotion is a separate validated operation.

Before 1.0 use `0.MINOR.PATCH`: meaningful player capability checkpoints increase MINOR/reset PATCH; fixes/compatibility/packaging increase PATCH. Reserve 1.0 for explicit scope and delivery acceptance, not the value alone. The menu label uses native small yellow text anchored within the loaded menu background.

Isolated diagnostic exporter identities are not live product releases and do not replace this authority. Read [release scope](NH_VERSION_1_0_SCOPE.md), [phase evidence](NH_PHASE1_EXIT_AUDIT.md) and [delivery contract](NH_DELIVERY_PIPELINE.md).
